*The architecture consists of three LSTM layers with dropout layers in between to prevent overfitting.
*dense layer (fully connected layer) is used for producing the output.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*The model processes a sequence of data with an input shape of (None, 100, 1), where:
- None: Represents the batch size, which can vary.
- 100: The number of time steps or sequence length.
- 1: The number of features in each time step.
*As the data passes through the layers, the model reduces the dimensionality of the information, down to a single output.

Layer-by-Layer Breakdown
1. LSTM Layer (lstm_9)
Input Shape: (None, 100, 1)
Output Shape: (None, 100, 30)
The LSTM layer processes the input sequence and outputs 30 features for each time step in the sequence.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Dropout Layer (dropout_9)
Input Shape: (None, 100, 30)
Output Shape: (None, 100, 30)
A dropout layer with a certain probability (usually 0.2 or 0.3) is added to prevent overfitting by randomly setting some outputs to zero during training.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. LSTM Layer (lstm_10)
Input Shape: (None, 100, 30)
Output Shape: (None, 100, 50)
This LSTM layer increases the number of features per time step to 50, allowing the model to learn more complex patterns from the sequence.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Dropout Layer (dropout_10)
Input Shape: (None, 100, 50)
Output Shape: (None, 100, 50)
Again, a dropout layer is added to reduce the risk of overfitting.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. LSTM Layer (lstm_11)
Input Shape: (None, 100, 50)
Output Shape: (None, 50)
This is the final LSTM layer. Unlike previous layers, it outputs a single vector with 50 features (not a sequence) by returning only the last time step.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Dropout Layer (dropout_11)
Input Shape: (None, 50)
Output Shape: (None, 50)
This dropout layer is applied to the output of the last LSTM layer.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Dense Layer (dense_3)
Input Shape: (None, 50)
Output Shape: (None, 1)
The dense layer (fully connected layer) reduces the 50-dimensional output vector to a single scalar value. This is typically used for regression or binary classification tasks.
